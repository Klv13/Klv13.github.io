            <p>

                I'm a kid. I don't do a lot of programming, but sometimes I make small projects which you can find here on the website. I mainly work in c# and with unity, but as you can see I have basic web development skills. I have an youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmRgGYJaE_PDpl9JUGIAeaQ">here</a>.

            <p>A game on itch. I made the game with unity and c#. It is a basic unlimited shooter game where you play as a triangle fighting off square cus, i don’t like squares ¯\_( ͡❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛)_/¯ or triangles are just better to draw graphics. But anyways it’s my first real game not that original, but i made it myself.</p>

            <p>A Dice thrower which tests the amount of throws you need to get the highest number on two dice with different sizes. I made this program because I had made another program where you could only choose one size. I then found out that the number of average attempts where the size of the dice raised to the power of two, I then asked myself: “Is it raised by two and then have some weird rule for different size dice, or do you just multiply the two dice sizes with each other?” I know that the second one sounds more likely and it also were the answer, but I just made the program anyways to be sure, and I was bored. ༼ つ ಥ_ಥ ༽つ</p>

            <p> Okay so very shortly this program will guess the integer you enter and output the same number, but it has compared it to every other number before your number until it was correct. The reason why I chose this method was because it was the most efficient I could find for totally random numbers. </p>
